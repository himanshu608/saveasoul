# SaveASoul (SAS): Your Personal Safety Network

SaveASoul (SAS) is a community-powered safety app designed to connect people who need help with those who are nearby and ready to assist. Our mission is to build a faster, more responsive, and more human safety net for everyone.

## How It Works

In an emergency, every second counts. SaveASoul (SAS) empowers you to get help quickly, not just from official responders, but from a network of trusted individuals in your immediate vicinity.

*   **Requesting Help:** If you feel unsafe or are in an emergency, simply press the "Get Help" button. The app will instantly share your location with nearby users who have volunteered to help, creating a rapid, localized response network.

*   **Helping Others:** If you're willing to help, you can receive alerts when someone nearby requests assistance. You'll be able to see their location and offer support, creating a powerful sense of community and mutual protection.

## Why Location Access is Crucial

To make this possible, SaveASoul (SAS) requires access to your device's location. This is not just a technical requirementâ€”it's the very core of our ability to keep you safe.

> As we explain in the app: *"To ensure we can assist you in an emergency, our app needs access to your location. This is crucial for our core safety features to function correctly."*

Without knowing your location, we can't connect you with helpers when you're in need, nor can we alert you when someone nearby requires your assistance. Your location data is handled securely and is only used for the explicit purpose of providing and receiving help in real-time.

## We're Stronger Together: Open for Contributions!

SaveASoul (SAS) is an open-source project driven by the belief that technology can and should be used to foster safer communities. We are actively looking for contributors who share our passion and want to make a real-world impact.
